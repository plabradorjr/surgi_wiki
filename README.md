# What is it?
SurgiWiki is an open-content collaborative database. A simple content management system (CMS). This Minimum Viable Product is designed for nurses and surgical techs as an easy way to answer their frequently asked questions. 

# Purpose

## Problem Overview
Put yourself in the shoes of a newly hired surgical tech or intra-op registered nurse. You have no idea where things are located. You have so many questions about a specific surgical procedure in your mind. Rather than focusing on patient care or other medical related tasks, you continually lose time trying to find simple items. There are no electronic documentations for supplies and frequently asked questions.

This app is built for you. SurgiWiki solves a recurring problem with a ruthlessly minimalistic CMS. Our department will always have new hires that can benefit from a search engine and database to effectively answer thier questions.

## Goal
The goal is to help nurses and surgical techs grow, regardless of experience level. The more we contribute and organize our information, the better off we'll be. More data is not always better, what we are really looking for is forward-motion.

## Design overview
SurgiApp is deliberately designed so that collaboration is key to its usefulness. Anyone can edit any entries. Without other peoples' contributions, this app leads nowhere, and information will remain outdated.

## Contributing
This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct.

The code is available as open source under the terms of the MIT License.
